Railfence Cipher decoder

This takes arguments ``rails`` and ``offset`` which you can set, 
but they will be bruteforce within the range of 2-10 and 0-10 
respectively.

This unit inherits from the 
:class:`katana.unit.NotEnglishAndPrintableUnit` class, as we can expect
the data to still be printable characters (letters, numbers and punctuation)
but not readable English. It also inherits from the 
:class:`katana.units.crypto.CryptoUnit` class to ensure it is not a viable
URL or potentially useful file.

The code for this is shamelessly stolen from
https://github.com/tothi/railfence
