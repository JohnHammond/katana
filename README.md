**Documentation:** [https://ctf-katana.readthedocs.io](https://ctf-katana.readthedocs.io)

This repository attempts to offer code and material to automate 
"running through the check-list" or hitting the "low-hanging fruit" in a 
Capture the Flag challenge. It is meant to act as a utility to help an 
individual _do things they might __otherwise forget to do__._

A lot of the context and ideas from this stem from the living document at 
[https://github.com/JohnHammond/ctf-katana](https://github.com/JohnHammond/ctf-katana)

Katana is written in Python 3.

**Please note that is project is not heavily maintained.**

DISCLAIMER
----------

**Katana will _automatically_ run code and do _potentially_ "malicious" things
to its target.** It may throw SQL injection, it may try test for local file
inclusion, uploading web shells or finding a means of remote code execution. 
**DO NOT, by any means, run this utility against ANYTHING that you do not have
explicit permission and authorization to test.**

We do not claim responsibility or involvement for anything you break or any 
trouble you may get into by using this tool.

Getting Started
---------------

We recommend running this with the latest version of Python and inside of a 
virtual environment.

**Lazy Way**

You can just run the installer script to install and setup katana.

```
chmod +x installer.sh
sudo ./installer.sh
```

**On Ubuntu**

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install -y python-tk tk-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev pandoc \
	libgmp3-dev libzbar-dev tesseract-ocr xsel libpoppler-cpp-dev libmpc-dev \
	libdbus-glib-1-dev ruby libenchant-dev apktool nodejs groff binwalk \
	foremost tcpflow poppler-utils exiftool steghide stegsnow bison ffmpeg \
	libgd-dev less
```

**Setup**

```
python3.7 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python setup.py install
```

If things seemed to wrong during your installation, and you just want a clean 
slate, you can tear down your virtual environment and start again. Note that 
you will need to run `python setup.py install` one more time.

If you're on a very old Ubuntu distribution and had to install Python 3.7
manually, you may need to install `virtualenv` manually, and use `virtualenv`
vice `python3.7 -m venv` like so:

```
pip3.7 install virtualenv
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```

After installation, Katana will still require multiple external dependencies.
The installation of each of these depends on your distribution and package
manager, so an easier solution is to run Katana through Docker. You can read
more about this in the [`docker/`](docker/) directory.


Usage
----------------

Whenever Katana runs, it creates a `results` directory where it stores its 
findings and **artifacts** (files et. al.) that may be generated from units.

Katana will not run if the `results` directory already exists. You can
have Katana automatically remove the `results` directory before it runs with
the `--force` command-line argument.

```bash
katana --force -f "FLAG{.*?}" "RkxBR3t0aGlzX2lzX2FfYmFzZTY0X2ZsYWd9"
```


Framework Methodology
---------------------

Katana works with a "boss -> worker" topology. One thread (the boss) spins off
other threads (the workers) and returns the results once they have all 
completed. Each worker is called a "unit". The unit is what actually goes 
about and accomplishes the task.

To add functionality to Katana, you simply need to create units. 
The boss will then handle them appropriately.

You can read more about it in the `docs` directory.

Thank You and Credits
-------------------------

As we got further along in development, we asked members of my Discord server 
if they would like to assist in creating units. The following is a list of 
units that were contributions from these members and their names, to offer our
 kudos and thank you. This project would not be what it is without your help!
